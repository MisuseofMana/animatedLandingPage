        <p>I'm Sean Yager, a.k.a Shinbone, a.k.a Misuse of Mana, and I'm a maker of all things digital located in Austin, TX. By day I code, create, and maintain a smattering of websites for various clients. By night I summon creatures, camaraderie, and conflicts to enrich my growing storytelling universe, the realm of Amara.</p>

        <p>I grew up in the cornfields of Indiana swinging tree branch swords and imagining backyard adventures. I went to college at IUPUI and Herron School of Art for several years before deciding that student debt was going to be a big burden. I took a hard pivot to learn Web Development via Austin Coding Academy and now I work as a freelancer in art and web design to offset my bills. I'm looking for more permenant work though so if you need a consultant, or an artist, or a website remodel please reach out!</p>
